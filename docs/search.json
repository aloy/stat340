Gradescope facilitates easier online grading of assignments than a simple Moodle submission. You can use gradscope to:\nSubmit homework online for grading .\nView feedback and scores.\nMake a re-grade request within prescribed guidelines.\nSubmission process\nWhen you need to complete a gradescope assignment, here are a few easy steps you will take to prepare and upload your assignment, as well as to see your assignment status and grades.\nComplete your assignment on paper or computer.\nSave your assignment to a pdf file format.\nUpload your assignment pdf file to gradescope.\nHow do I access gradescope?\nYou can click on a link to gradescope at the top of our course page. Alternatively, there is a link to gradescope on the homework page.\nHow do I get help with gradescope?\nIf you need help with your assignment instructions and/or logistics, please contact me. There are also a great wiki on using gradescope.\nDo I need to complete my assignment on a computer to submit it to gradescope?\nNo. You can complete your assignment on paper; then you will need to scan it so you have a PDF file to submit to gradescope.\nAlternatively, if you completed your assignment on a computer (e.g. using MSWord, Google docs, or LaTeX), save that file as a PDF and submit to gradescope. If you do typeset your assignment, please use proper mathematical notation.\nI have complete my assignment on paper; how do I prepare it for submission to gradescope?\nYou can scan the pages of your assignment into a single PDF by using one of the scanners in the Libe.\n–OR–\nYou can use a free app (available for iOS and Android devices) to take pictures that are translated into a PDF (see this guide).\nI have complete my assignment on the computer; how do I prepare it for submission to gradescope?\nPrint to PDF or scan to PDF:\nGiven that you completed your homework on a computer, the best way to get a clear and legible scanned version is to “print to pdf” (or knit to PDF) and save the output as a PDF file. If that is not possible with the file format you used to complete the homework, the next best option is to print your assignment and then scan the page(s) to PDF.\nI have the file(s) with my scanned assignment; now how do I submit to gradescope?\nSee this video or this webpage for instructions.\nHow much time should I allow for submitting my assignment to gradescope?\nThe first few times, allow an extra 10 minutes to successfully submit an assignment to gradescope. Remember that you need to create a pdf file of your assignment (i.e., scanned version) to submit.\nHow do I check my grade on an assignment?\nI will import your marks into Moodle’s gradebook, so you will be able to see your makrs under the grades tab. See the next item How do I review my feedback… for information on how to get detailed score information and feedback on your work.\nHow do I review my feedback on an assignment graded with gradescope?\nOnce your assignment is graded and you log into gradescope via Moodle, you will see all grading rubrics, and rubric items applied to your submission will be highlighted. Click on a question name within the assignment to view the rubric items for that question and any comments. Viewing the rubric is a great way to get feedback about your work. See this page for more details.\nHow do I submit a regrade request?\nSee this webpage for details.\nCredit\nThis guide was adapted from CMU’s guide on gradescope.\n\n\n\n",
